    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure Authorization Independence, DBAC, and QAPs. It leverages path-based ownership for private user data (blog posts) and avoids hierarchical `get()` calls in security rules.\n\n*   **`/users/{userId}`:** Stores user profiles. This collection uses path-based ownership, making security rules straightforward (`request.auth.uid == userId`).\n*   **`/users/{userId}/blogPosts/{blogPostId}`:** Stores blog posts owned by a specific user. This follows the path-based ownership pattern, ensuring that only the authenticated user (`request.auth.uid == userId`) can access their own blog posts. The structure inherently supports secure `list` operations (QAPs) as rules can simply check `request.auth.uid == userId` without needing to filter based on document content.\n\nThis structure promotes clarity, predictability, and simplifies security rule implementation while adhering to the core design principles."
